## SUMMARY
I'm a technology enthusiast with a strong command of scripting and programming languages, including C, Python, Shell Scripting, and PowerShell. I excel in planning and building processes, utilizing tools like Azure DevOps, Trello, GitHub, Bitbucket, and Git. My experience also encompasses releasing and deploying tools such as Docker, Jenkins, Azure Pipeline, and GitHub Actions. I'm skilled in orchestration, configuration, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform. My proficiency extends to monitoring and security tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Kiali, Jaegar, and SonarQube. In cloud technologies, I've worked with Azure (Blob Storage, Virtual Networks, Traffic Manager) and AWS (IAM, EC2, VPC). I'm well-versed in Linux environments (Ubuntu), Windows, Dagger, Qovery, Slack, GitOps, and Promtail.
